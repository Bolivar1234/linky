Exciting news! Glow is now Linky.

Since soft-launching in 2023, Glow has grown in to a community of over 3000 creators.

From artists to entrepreneurs, we've seen a lot of amazing creators use Glow to share their links with the world.

However, we've found that Glow doesn't really capture the spirit of what we're trying to build: the best link in bio tool for creators.

So we wanted a name that instantly tells you what we're all about—easy, intuitive links that help you effortlessly connect your audience to your content.

Thanks for growing with us! We're thrilled for this next chapter with you and your Linky links ✨

### Can I still use glow.as links?

All of your existing glow.as links will continue to work seamlessly, automatically redirecting to our shiny new lin.ky domain. Although we recommend updating your profile on your socials to link to lin.ky, you don't currently need to change a thing—just keep sharing your links, and we'll handle the rest.

### What's the new domain?

You can now find us at [lin.ky](https://lin.ky). Your page will automatically redirect to the new domain. Your username will remain the same. For example, if your username was `jack`, you can now find your page at [lin.ky/jack](https://lin.ky/jack).
